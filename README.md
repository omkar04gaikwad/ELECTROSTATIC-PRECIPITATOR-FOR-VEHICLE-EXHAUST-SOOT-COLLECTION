# ELECTROSTATIC-PRECIPITATOR-FOR-VEHICLE-EXHAUST-SOOT-COLLECTION

The invention consists of an electrostatic precipitator inside a small ceramic barrel attached at the
end of vehicle exhaust along with a meager controller box attached to the underside of the
automobile. It is powered by the principal automotive battery and uses the collected soot from the
cartridge to produce ink. The exhaust quality, filter status, carbon content, and cartridge life are
timely sent via push notifications to the user. Allowing them to refill and clean and reimburse their
old cartridges for the new ones at relatively small sums of money. The invention's core technical
innovation is Electrostatic precipitator's collector and ionizing cartridges in a hexagonal close
packing structure for reduced back pressure on engines. The uniqueness in the design is that it is IoT
enabled, cheap feasible electrostatic precipitator with adaptive sensors to notify the status of
collector cartridge. The product is optimized to aid engine performance along with the filtering. This
invention has an extensive market potential as it enables the usage of diesel engines in cities with
strict emissions. The ink generated as a by-product has a revenue of its own. Moreover, the impact it
has on the environment is enormous as it contributes to cleaner air by removing particulate matter.
